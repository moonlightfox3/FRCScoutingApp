Needs
    Server
        Add button to submit LocalStorage (can submit as practice or for an event) - form submit button? (also clears LocalStorage on success, tells user the result)
        Holds list of events and current event (can clear very old events to save storage, but keep a few recent ones)
    Pit scouting - index toggle, load different forms
    Service worker - if possible, check if latest commit has been pushed to GitHub Pages, and don't update cache if it hasn't

Wants
    Dev branch - test code before using on main
    LocalStorage file viewer

Luxuries
    Internal tab system (different pages)

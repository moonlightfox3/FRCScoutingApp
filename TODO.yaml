Needs
    Server
        Add button to submit LocalStorage (can submit as practice or for an event) - form type=submit button? (also clears LocalStorage on success, tells user the result)
        Holds list of events and current event (can clear somewhat old events to save storage, but might as well keep a few recent ones)

Wants
    Dev branch - test code before using on main (will GitHub Pages host this? also does the GitHub API usage change for this?)

Luxuries
    LocalStorage file viewer
    Internal tab system (different pages, quick navigation)
